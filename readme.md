# Gan Architectures

MLP Gan, DCGan, WGan with Gradient Cliping, WGan with gradient penalty.

This a more object-oriented design to the code of [Zeleni9](https://github.com/Zeleni9/pytorch-wgan).
It was part of an assignment of an Advanced Deep Learning course.

This project was built using Visual Studio, so all python code is under the GanArchitectures folder.

## Dependencies
1. Pytorch 1.6.x
2. Tensorflow 2.0.x
